# OpenSSLTextTool
Barebones Windows batch script to manage encrypting and decrypting of text.
Made as light as possible wth as little dependancy as possible.  Uses only the OpenSSL tool and the windows operating system.
Should be accessible for anyone to use and actually look at the scripts with understanding.  Read the README folder to start.
